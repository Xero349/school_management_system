Project Goal:

The primary objective of the School Data System based on the Indian School system is to develop a dashboard that offers insights into student enrollment, demographics, and financial contributions across various classes and regions. By integrating data visualization tools such as dashboards, charts, and maps, the system aims to simplify school data, facilitate informed decision-making, and show transparency in fee collection and student management. The dashboard will also show a balance academic and financial tracking by gender, class, and geography while providing information on fee payments at both the individual and institutional levels.

Project Summary:

The dashboard offers a view of the Indian School System operations by highlighting key metrics, such as the number of students by gender, fee collection trends by quarter, and student contributions at both citywide and statewide levels. It consolidates information from five classes, collecting data on 100 students and their associated fee payments, which total approximately $1.79 million across all quarters.  Data visualizations include a gender distribution chart (with 50% male and 50% female students), maps showing student locations, and bar charts illustrating the total fees paid by each student. From a financial perspective, the system tracks fee payment performance over four quarters, which demonstrates steady growth up to Quarter 2, followed by a plateau in Quarters 3 and 4. The bar graphs reveal that most students contribute consistently, although there are some students who paid less than the average students financially. Overall, the dashboard breaks down each students financial distribution across various regions, which could provide insights on what resources could be allocated to these areas for students who are struggling to pay for various fees.
